Fetlife API for PHP
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zordtk/fetlife-php.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zordtk/fetlife-php)

Overview
--------
This library is a implementation of Fetlife's API in PHP. It's based on
Fetlife's open-source Android client.

TODO
----
I do plan to encapsulate each data type (user profile, event, message, etc) into
it's own object, but that will be in the future.
